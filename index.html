  <h1>Forest</h1>
  <p>
    Forest is a programming language that compiles to WebAssembly,
    featuring a strong static type system, customizable syntax and
    an approach to immutability and garbage collection that is fast,
    safe, and predictable.
  </p>

  <h2>Type System</h2>
  <p>
    Forest has a strong static type system that is heavily inspired by languages like Haskell and Elm.

    There is currently only a very simple implementation, but it is capable of checking parameter types, return types,
    function application, and more.
  </p>

  <h2>Syntax</h2>
  <p>
    Part of the impetus for creating Forest was wanting to have a place to explore the creation
    of visual editors for functional applications. We realized that in order for a visual editor
    to be a truely worthwhile experience, it needs to be a first class citizen alongside the textual syntax.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.luna-lang.org/">Luna</a> is already an inspiration here, with a dual visual/text representation
    and a hybrid editor. However, we believe that the community should be free to experiment and find what works best for them.

    That's why in Forest, there is no canonical syntax imposed by the language. Each user picks a syntax they like, but we can all still work together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since Haskell and Elm are the basis for Forest's programming model, the Haskell syntax is the first to be developed.

    Here is a simple fibonacci program, projected to Forest's Haskell syntax.
  </p>

  <pre>
fib :: Int -> Int
fib i =
  case i of
    0 -> 1
    1 -> 1
    i -> fib (i - 2) + fib (i - 1)

main :: Int
main =
  let
    a = fib 5
    b = fib 10
  in
    a + b
  </pre>

  <p>
    Here is the same program, in Forest's TypeScript syntax.
  </p>

  <pre>
function fib(i: Int): Int {
  switch (i) {
    case 0: 1;
    case 1: 1;
    case i: fib(i - 2) + fib(i - 1);
  }
}

function main(): Int {
  let a = fib(5);
  let b = fib(10);

  a + b;
}
  </pre>

  <p>
    Notice that this is not actually valid TypeScript. It's more a syntax that would be mostly
    familiar to someone who has primarily worked with TypeScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some might object to the use of semicolons in this example, since they're not even strictly needed
    in JavaScript. This is a perfect example of one of the reasons it's nice to be able to customize your syntax.
  </p>

  <p>
    A syntax in Forest is a parser and a printer for a given grammar. All syntaxes parse and print to and from the same
    data structure. So if you like, you could have printer that included semicolons, or perhaps not.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order for a syntax to be considered valid, it must be able to take any arbitrary Forest module, print it,
    and then re-parse the printed output and arrive at the same module.
  </p>

  <h2>Memory Management</h2>

  <p>
    Pure functional programming with a helpful compiler is a great experience,
    and thanks to language like Elm and PureScript it's already possible in the browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the reasons this style of programming is great is immutability. Mutable updates
    to shared objects are a common source of bugs in JavaScript. However, immutability has the overhead
    of allocating memory for every update. This means that it's pretty much impossible
    to avoid pauses for garbage collection if you program with Elm or PureScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn't that bad for most conventional web applications, but Forest is designed
    to be fast enough to allow development complex games and machine learning algorithms in the browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    Forest aims to take advantage of the new world that WebAssembly provides
    by avoiding the JavaScript memory model, and instead opting for a memory model
    similar to Rust. When possible, memory will be kept on the stack, and otherwise
    it will be tracked by reference counting.
  </p>

  <p>
    One advantage Forest has over Rust is that in Forest, everything is immutable.
    That means we can use a neat optimization where if we're updating an object, and
    that object is only referenced at the callsite, we can perform the update in place.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means that in many cases, you can program in Forest with the guarantees of immutability
    while incurring minimal overhead when compared to JavaScript runtime immutability.
  </p>
